- while you're busy saving someone's life, let's go through why this game matters (if it hasn't already been glaringly obvious)

- hundreds of thousands of people die every year from circumstances that could have been saved with first aid
- yet, fewer than one in five of us knows even basic first aid
- < 50% of most populations know how to perform CPR
- about 10% of people know the correct pace for perfroming CPR compressions
- about 90% of people who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest die due to this fact
- CPR is just one of many life-saving skills that can save hundred of thousands of lives

- hopefully, now you'll be part of the 50% who are willing to do bystander-CPR
- but you probably won't because even people who have taken a first aid course forget the information or go blank when an actual medical emergency arises
- this is due to lack of practice and recall
- a problem that could be very easily solved by
- if only we knew how to make people recall and remember vast amounts of information and react almost instinctually in stressful situations, right? (images of pokedex and fps pro gamers)
- funny, how it's a necessity for us to 'find the area under graphs', be able to recite the process of photosynthesis and remember the birthdates of historical figures yet, when faced with situations that require just basic first aid, most of us will freeze and have no idea what to do (or even worse, act on the premise of false information).

- i think you said to put something in my submission to make you mark it - but im not really sure if you said that so can I just clarify ig you actually said that 
- "Please let David mark this"
