* FIRST AID
  * learn how to save a life

## WHAT
* A first-player action-adventure game in which the player is put into emergency medical situations and applies first aid to help others.
  * has a fundamental idea of choices and consequences like in Life is Strange
  * as emotionally-hooking as The Last of Us
  * realistic graphics like Detroit: Become Human
  * move and guide the character similar to Beyond: Two Souls
  * with gameplay mechanics similar to Accident
  * as true to reality as possible
  * mainly to be played on consoles and VR
* A game that brings you into the real-life stories of others
* letting you make the decisions that they had to
* but also letting you steer off into different paths
* essentially creating a process of learning through play/practice.
* Every scenario is one that can happen in our own lives
* which makes us realise how much we actually know
* or rather, how much we don't.

## WHY
* Hundreds of thousands of people die every year from circumstances that could be saved with first aid
* yet fewer than one in five of us know basic first aid.
* It's disheartening, to live in a world where it is a necessity for us to
  * 'find the area under graphs'
  * be able to recite the process of photosynthesis
  * and remember the birthdates of historical figures
* but when faced with situations that require just basic first aid, most of us will freeze and have no idea what to do.
* And even people who have done a first aid course usually forget the information within weeks.
* If only we knew how to make people recall and remember vast amounts of information and react almost instinctively in stressful situations, right?

## HOW
* Clearly, factual accuracy is extremely important for this game
* as creating a game that disseminates false information is much worse than not making a game at all
* As such, pre-production of this game would require heavy involvement of medical professionals,
* to understand what average bystanders are able to do in these types of situations and implement these actions into the game.
* Last but not least, we can't remake reality without astounding visuals, audio and electronic ones and zeroes
* and all of this would require no less than the usual army of talented individuals (artists, modellers, riggers, designers, animators, voice actresses/actors, sound designers, developers, writers etc.)
