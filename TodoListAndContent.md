      - The game is made up of multiple stories, with each story either teaching the player a new first aid concept, idea or skill, or getting the player to apply the knowledge learnt from previous stories to a scenario. Inspired by how actual first aid training courses are run, the game recreates real-life scenarios for players to learn and practice first aid.
      - Players play as a different character in every story. Playing as anyone anywhere not only allows the game to be able to appeal to a greater audience but also captures the fact that we could all find ourselves in situations that require first aid at any point in our lives; thus emphasizing the vital importance of learning first aid.
